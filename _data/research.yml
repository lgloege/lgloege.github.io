  My research focuses on understanding how carbon and nutrients
  move around in large water bodies. I am interested in how biology and physics
  mediate this transport. By understanding the dominant mechanisms moving nutrients
  around we gain insight into how the ecosystem and climate change over time.
  Tools I use include: 3D computer models, in-situ observations, and satellite data.

  - title: Biological Carbon Pump
    id: bcp
    description: >
      The shunt of photosynthetically derived particulate organic carbon (POC)
      out of the surface ocean is an integral component of the “biological pump.”
      POC raining through the deep ocean
      is remineralized back to dissolved inorganic carbon though microbial respiration.
      This work has implications for understanding how the climate and ecosystem services
      will change in the future.

    figureCap: >
     The figure shows POC flux from moored sites around the globe.
     POC sequestered below 1000 m will not see the atmosphere for at least 100 years.
     I am interested in how this POC flux is paramterized in computer models and understanding
     the mechanisms that are important on a global scale.

  - title: Lake Michigan
    id: lm
    description: >
      Nutrient and total suspended solids (TSS)
      loading are two stressors that degrade Great Lakes coastal
      ecosystems and the services they provide, such as drinking water,
      fisheries, and recreational opportunities. High nutrient
      inputs from urban and agricultural runoff continue to cause
      local eutrophication. A recent survey of Lake Michigan
      tributaries shows summer nutrient loads spanning three
      orders of magnitude, with higher values in regions dominated
      by agricultural and urban land use type. Understanding in more
      detail how vertical stratification and coastal circulation impacts the
      redistribution of tributary inputs in the coastal zone of
      Lake Michigan is imperative. This is a first step in understanding how tributary
      load redistributions are impacted by the hydrodynamics
      of the coastal zone.  This work has implications in
      assessing how management efforts
      could be better targeted to protect the coastal zone.

      The figure shows output from a computer model where a time
      varying dye release was simulated.
      A concentration of 1 is equivalent to the dye being
      well-mixed throughout the entire basin. Each river has a dramatically
      different footprint, look at how the St. Joseph stays coastal!

  - title: pCO2 gap-filling
    id: pco2
    description: >
      The ocean serves an important ecosystem service by reducing the impact of human derived
      carbon dioxide emissions. Quantifying how much carbon the ocean uptakes is difficult
      since there are gaps in the ocean pCO2 data record.
      Methods have been developed to fill in these gaps but the methods produce different
      results and it is unclear which method is correct, which is essential to determine which
      mapping methods can be used in global carbon budget assessments.
      A more accurate global carbon budget will help to assess whether the goals of the
      UNFCC Paris climate agreement are being achieved.
