This is the latest iteration of my personal webpage. Instead of relying of frameworks such as bootstrap and jquery I decided  to write everything by hand. This webpage is very simple but it will help me understand HTML, CSS, and Javascript better. 

## Adding new features
open code in VSCode and and use Live Server to view webpage.

1. make your changes
2. add changes: ```git add <files>```
3. commit changes: ```git commit -am "comment"```
4. push changes: ```git push origin source:master```


## Limitations
- scroll nav is achieved by ```html { scroll-behavior: smooth;}``` . However, this does not work on some browsers, notably Safari.
- ```transform: ;``` may not work on some browsers. 

## Things to add
- new section: "Recent work"
- new section: "Other writing"
- add link to CV
- add link to MS PDFs

## Things to consider
- template the site using Hugo
- Show off a little CSS by adding a CSS build background.
